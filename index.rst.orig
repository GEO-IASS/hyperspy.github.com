HyperSpy: multi-dimensional data analysis toolbox
================================================

HyperSpy is an open source Python library which provides tools to facilitate
the interactive data analysis of multi-dimensional datasets that can be
described as multi-dimensional arrays of a given signal (e.g. a 2D array of
spectra a.k.a spectrum image).

HyperSpy aims at making it easy and natural to apply analytical procedures that
operate on an individual signal to multi-dimensional arrays, as well as
providing easy access to analytical tools that exploit the multi-dimensionality
of the dataset.

Its modular structure makes it easy to add features to analyze different kinds

of signals. Currently there are specialized tools for electron
energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy dispersive X-rays (EDX) data
analysis.

Highlights
==========


<<<<<<< HEAD
* Two families of named and scaled axes: *signal* and *navigation*.
* Visualization tools for multi-dimensional spectra and images.
* Easy access multi-dimensional curve fitting and blind source separation.
* Built on top of NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and scikit-learn.
=======
* Named and scaled axes.
* Axes indexing by name.
* Non-equivalent axes: HyperSpy distinguishes between  *signal* and *navigation*
  axes.
* Iteration over the navigation axes.
* Advanced data indexing capabilities including separate indexing for the
  *signal* and *navigation* axes and data indexing using using axis units.
* Visualization tools for n-dimensional spectra and images based on matplotlib.
* Curve fitting.
* Easy access to machine learning e.g. PCA, ICA...
* Reading and writing of multidimensional datasets in multiple file formats.
>>>>>>> origin/master
* Modular design for easy extensibility.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The development has been motivated by the data analysis needs of the
electron microscopy community but it is proving useful in many other fields.
