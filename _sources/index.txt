 Hyperspy: Hyperspectral data analysis toolbox
==============================================

Hyperspy provides a rich toolbox for hyperspectral data analysis: 

* Reads and writes multiple popular hyperspectral formats, especially from the domain of electron microscopy.
* Performs curve fitting on multidimensional datasets.
* Machine learning e.g. PCA, ICA...
* Easy to use and customise.
* Specially well suited for electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) data analysis.

Hyperspy is open source (released under the revised GPL v3 license) and it is actively
developed and used in research (see 
`the Bibliography section of the User Guide 
<http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/dev/user-guide/bibliography.html>`_)

Hyperspy supports Python 2.6 to 2.7 but it does not support Python 3 yet.
