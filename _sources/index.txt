 Hyperspy: Hyperspectral data analysis toolbox
==============================================

Hyperspy is an open source library providing tools for interactive data
analysis of multidimensional datasets. It is specially well-suited (but not
limited) to spectroscopy data analysis.

Main features:
* Data structures to easily operate on multidimensional datasets with
  integrated indexing and iterators.
* Visualization of n-dimensional spectra and images. 
* Curve fitting.
* Machine learning e.g. PCA, ICA...
* Reading and writing of multidimensional datasets in multiple file formats.

Hyperspy is released under the GPL v3 license and is actively
developed and used in research (see 
`the Bibliography section of the User Guide 
<http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/user_guide/bibliography.html>`_)
