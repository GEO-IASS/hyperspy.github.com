 Hyperspy: Hyperspectral data analysis toolbox
==============================================

Hyperspy provides a rich toolbox to help you make the most out of your 
hyperspectral data. Some features:

* Reads and writes multiple popular hyperspectral formats.
* Performs curve fitting on multidimensional datasets.
* Principal Components Analysis.
* Independent components analysis.
* Easy to use and customise.
* Special functions for EELS data analysis. Other signals coming soon.

Hyperspy is open source (released under the revised GPL v3 license), and has 
been already used to obtain results that are published in research articles (see 
`the Bibliography section of the User Guide 
<http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/dev/user-guide/bibliography.html>`_.


Hyperspy supports Python 2.6 to 2.7 but it does not support Python 3 yet.
