.. WARNING::
   
   **Uninstalling HyperSpy in Windows can delete unrelated files.** This issue
   `was reported
   <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/hyperspy-users/xEkQXlY345I/HZ8-0v9kfNkJ>`_
   on the 27th of November 2013. It only affects the full installers for
   Windows of HyperSpy version 0.6 when installing in certain customized
   locations. If you have installed this version of HyperSpy in Windows please
   :ref:`read this <uninstallation_issue>` before uninstalling HyperSpy.
   If you are about to install HyperSpy 0.6, you can avoid this issue by not
   changing the default installation folder during the installation process. We
   are currently working in fixing this bug and we will make available a new
   installer for HyperSpy version 0.6 as soon as possible.

ImportRPL Digital Micrograph plugin
-----------------------------------

Lastest version release date: 24/05/2012. Minor bugs were solved and new features added.

This Digital Micrograph plugin is designed to import Ripple files into Digital Micrograph. It is used to easy data transit between DigitalMicrograph and Hyperspy without losing the calibration using the extra keywords that Hyperspy adds to the standard format.

When executed it will ask for 2 files:

#. The riple file with the data  format and calibrations 
#. The data itself in raw format.

If a file with the same name and path as the riple file exits
with raw or bin extension it is opened directly without prompting
