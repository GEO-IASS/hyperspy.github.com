ImportRPL Digital Micrograph plugin
-----------------------------------

This Digital Micrograph plugin is designed to import Ripple files into Digital Micrograph. It is used to easy data transit between DigitalMicrograph and Hyperspy without losing the calibration using the extra keywords that Hyperspy adds to the standard format.

When executed it will ask for 2 files:

#. The riple file with the data  format and calibrations 
#. The data itself in raw format.

If a file with the same name and path as the riple file exits
with raw or bin extension it is opened directly without prompting

ImportRPL was written by Luiz Fernando Zagonel.
