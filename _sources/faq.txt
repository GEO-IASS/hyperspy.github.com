Why did you change the name of the project
------------------------------------------
    Hey, I have been using EELSLab since version 0.x just because I liked very 
    much to type its name, why did you change it now?
    
**Answer:** We feel that the project has grown much beyond the scope that the 
old name suggested. We think that "Hyperspectral Spy" describes much better the 
current features and goals of the project. Yo do not agree? Well, then we think 
that Hyperspectral Python describes much better the 
current features and goals of the project.
